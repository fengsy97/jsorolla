export default class LitUtils {

    /* Problem:
    *
    * The function name must not be the same. (maximum stack call size exceeded)
    * Without static Javascript not recognize this as a function
    * Not matter if this class extend LitElement not recognize "dispatchEvent".
    * Solution:
    *
    * We need to pass "this" from component as "self" to work
    * If we pass "this" is not necessary to the class extends LitElement.
    *
    * Other solution it converts this class as class mixin.
    *
    * Pros:
    * it's not necessary to pass "this";
    * it recognizes all LitElements functions.
    *
    * Cons:
    * Should be extended from the class mixin and pass LitElement as parameter
    * Ex: export default class NameComponent extends ClassMixin(LitElement) {....}
